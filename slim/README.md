# Claude Code Security Framework (Slim)

Security governance framework for Claude Code deployments. This is the slim version — core security essentials for web and API development. For the full enterprise version (mobile, infrastructure, compliance mapping, incident response), see the parent directory.

## What This Is

CLAUDE.md files and supporting documents that enforce security policies when teams use Claude Code. The framework operates at two layers:

1. **Platform enforcement** (`managed-settings-template.jsonc`): Controls what Claude Code CAN DO (tool permissions, file access restrictions). Deployed via MDM. Users cannot override.
2. **Enterprise governance** (CLAUDE.md): Controls organizational policy (company accounts, secrets management, license compliance, AI agent risk controls, web/API security).

Both layers work alongside [Project CodeGuard](https://project-codeguard.org/) for technical code security patterns.

## File Structure

```
├── CLAUDE.md                          # Security rules (loads every interaction)
├── managed-settings-template.jsonc    # Platform-level permission enforcement template
├── .gitignore                         # Prevents secrets from being committed
├── README.md                          # This file

    └── secrets-management.md          # WRONG/CORRECT code examples
```

## Quick Start (Managed / Enterprise)

For organizations with MDM (Jamf, Intune, etc.):

1. Clone this repo
2. Customize `[COMPANY NAME]` in `CLAUDE.md`
3. Install Project CodeGuard: `/plugin marketplace add cosai-oasis/project-codeguard`
4. Deploy `managed-settings-template.jsonc` via MDM (remove `_comment`, `_paths`, and `_customize` keys first)
   - macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
   - Linux: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`
   - Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json`
5. Copy `CLAUDE.md` into your project repositories

## Quick Start (Non-Managed / Small Team)

1. Copy `CLAUDE.md` into the root of your project repo
2. Customize `[COMPANY NAME]` to your team or project name
3. Install Project CodeGuard in Claude Code
4. Configure `.claude/settings.json` in your project for permission rules:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Bash(rm -rf:*)",
      "Bash(sudo:*)",
      "Bash(git push --force:*)",
      "Bash(git push -f:*)",
      "Bash(git reset --hard:*)",
      "Read(**/.env)",
      "Read(**/.env.*)",
      "Read(**/*.pem)",
      "Read(**/*.key)",
      "Read(**/*id_rsa*)"
    ],
    "ask": [
      "Bash(curl:*)",
      "Bash(wget:*)",
      "Bash(git push:*)",
      "Bash(npm install:*)",
      "Bash(pip install:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Settings Precedence (highest to lowest)

| Priority | File | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `managed-settings.json` (system path) | All users on machine |
| 2 | `.claude/settings.local.json` | This project, this user only |
| 3 | `.claude/settings.json` | This project, all collaborators |
| 4 | `~/.claude/settings.json` | All projects for this user |

Rules are evaluated in order: **deny > ask > allow** (first match wins).

## Customization

Before deploying:

- Replace `[COMPANY NAME]` in CLAUDE.md
- Adjust secrets management tool references to match your cloud provider
- Review and customize managed-settings deny/ask rules for your workflows
- Add or remove approved licenses based on Legal team input
